# MLP_by_Numpy
The multilayer perceptron model is implemented by Numpy and Scipy.

In "cMLP.py", class "cDense" implements the single fully connected layer.
And by stacking "cDense", class "cMLP_Model" can implement the MLP model for classfication
with adam or stochastic gradient optimizer.

Two activation functions, "relu" and "softmax", are implemented.
